<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> Written by one of my favorite authors, despite having only written a few books - Alan Brinkley (who recently passed away). 

This is extremely, extremely prescient as America deals with Covid-19. It's only 4 pages long but worth reading for the history and context of civil liberties in times of crisis. It is within human nature to seek immediate safety at any cost, this talks about what that cost has been in the past
