<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> One of my favorite business memos. What's crazy to me is that I was expecting some incredibly detailed, behind the scenes, magical explanation of the business by one of the best to ever do it. But all ~30 pages really could have been summed up as - 'tell great stories, ignore the noise, and results will follow'. Obviously he knows the finer details of how movies are made, but it's refreshing to see someone of his stature reducing the business to such simplicity instead of a bunch of engineered data analysis. 

Worth your time.
