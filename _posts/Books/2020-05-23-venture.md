<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> If you are an entreprenuer, or anyone who thinks they will see a term sheet in their future, read this book. 

What's so well done is the simplicity of explanations as well as the cadence of the book. Those two qualities make it truly entreprenur friendly.
