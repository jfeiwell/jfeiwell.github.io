<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> I think this is probably Isaacson's best book. Franklin is n of 1. It's incredible how many different career's he had. Publisher, Printer, Scientist, Inventor, Diplomat, etc. One wonders how a current day Franklin would be received in a world steeped in "expertise". 

I did not realize that his lifespan was squarely inside the 18th century. By the time the Revolution rolled around he was an old man. If there's one knock on Franklin's life is that he remained loyal to the Crown for far too long, but eventually he came around.
