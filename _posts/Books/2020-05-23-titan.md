<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> This is a good but not great book. It's detailed and you certainly get a sense for who Rockefeller was. He was absolutely brilliant and a deeply religious man. It's a bit dry and kind of a slog though. 

tl;dr on Rockefeller as the "evil monopolist" is that he was a man of his times. There weren't rules and regs so he really was playing by the standards at the time. Like any vertical integration, consumers benefitted and competition suffered.
