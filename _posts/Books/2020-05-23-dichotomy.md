<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> The sequel to [*Extreme Ownership*](https://jfeiwell.com/books/2020/05/23/ownership.html). The point of this book is to illustrate that leadership isn't one way or the other, it's a delicate balance.

You want to be 'aggressive but not reckless', 'disciplined, not rigid', 'humble, but not passive'. Every chapter illustrates how to navigate these questions ever leader asks themselves.
