<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> Probably my favorite business book. I read it in its entirety during finals week jr. year, whoops. 

A gripping account of what was the largest LBO in history at the time. Henry Kravis and George Roberts built the PE industry and they were not going to be out maneuvered within their own game. 

A must read.
