<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> From the book's description: "highly accessible and authoritative book that focuses on the primary valuation methodologies currently used on Wall Street?comparable companies, precedent transactions, DCF, and LBO analysis. These methodologies are used to determine valuation for public and private companies within the context of M&A transactions, LBOs, IPOs, restructurings, and investment decisions."

This book is worth its weight in gold if you want to learn rudimentary valuation techniques. Excellent entry level resource that I have highlighter on almost every page.
