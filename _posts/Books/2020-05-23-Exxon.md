<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> Walt Disney was not going to fail. Period. Sold his cars, mortgage his home, you name it - Disney was going to do it to succeed. 

There are parts that aren't terribly entertaining, but on net it's everything you could ask for in a Walt Disney biography. From his upbringing and start in Kansas City to his war against Herbert Sorrell (who started the untrue rumors Walt was Anti-Semitic), you'll learn on every page.
