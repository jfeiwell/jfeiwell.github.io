<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> This book makes you realize that it's a big, cold world. The prices you pay at the pump aren't dictated by some good old fashioned bargaining. 

'Private Empire' is spot on. Exxon has to go to some of the most dangerous places on Earth to keep the oil flowing. That requires an operation that's a bit more sophisticated and realpolitik than most companies. 

It's an incredibly entertaining and informative read. I'd prefer to stay on Lee Raymond's good side...
