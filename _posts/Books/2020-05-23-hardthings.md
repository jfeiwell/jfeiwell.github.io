<div style="margin-top:15px;"></div>

<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> Could also be titled "Lessons in keeping it real: company building isn't black and white". This is a great book on entrepreneurship every aspiring and current entrepreneur should read. It wrestles with the questions that everyone has that the de facto guides don't answer. When everything is going haywire, how to pull through. Throw out all the b-school books and read this. 

Also a quick read which I like.
