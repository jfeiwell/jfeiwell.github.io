<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> Buy. This. Book.

This book, first written in 2014, can be described in one word: **prophetic**.

This is one of the rare books that, once you read it, you will not look at the world in the same way. Martin, a former CIA media analyst, ties together how the "fifth wave" of information (the internet) impacts politics. Now that the information is flowing in both directions, citizens across the world are waking up to the fact our elites aren't infallible. This has resulted in an assault on the "center" from the "border". But the border doesn't want to govern, only burn it all down. 

Read this book, you will not be sorry.
