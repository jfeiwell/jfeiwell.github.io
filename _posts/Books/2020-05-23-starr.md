<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> A little wonky at first, the substance makes up for the lack of readability. 

Starr tells the story of American media by explaining many of the outcomes were shaped by political decisions. For example the postal service treating newspapers differently allowed them to spread quicker.

Like me, Starr believes communications and media touch everything. He does an excellent job of explaining how. 

This book should have won more awards.
