<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> One of the most inspiring books I've read. Adams has largely been forgotten or written into the role of a founder that is only worthy of having a lager named in his honor but he was so much more than that. Not only was he one of the very first founders to see the future and call for a break from the Crown, he did more from ~1755-1776 to actually make it materialize. 

He was destined for a quiet, religious life but he was called for something much greater and proved incredibly deft. An easy read too!
