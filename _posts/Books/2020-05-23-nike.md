<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> Great book, easy read. This book gets a ton of love as one of the best business books, I'm slightly more bearish. It's a must read and definitely illustrates just how hard Knight worked to get Nike off the ground, but it's just a bit over-hyped in my opinion due to a lack of detail.
