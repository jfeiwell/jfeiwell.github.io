<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> There is *a lot* of money in Hollywood that goes beyond box office and dvds. Written in 2013 you can tell Ulin knows his stuff, predicting some of the world we now inhabit (a newer editon was released in 2019). 

Read this if you're interested in how Hollywood economics really works. Hollywood accounting is...creative.
