<span style="font-weight:500;">tl;dr:</span> The third, best, and Pulitzer Prize winning volume of what is the goat of biographies.

Two things stuck with me. 

1) He was doggedly relentless. Adjectives don't do it justice. The man didn't use an alarm clock. He called Senator's homes in the middle of the night and wouldn't let them hang up until he got a yes. Any entrepreneur should read this to understand how bad he **needed** it. 

2) Again - how blatantly corrupt he was. How did he get so rich? The Austin radio stations he owned were technically in Lady Bird's name. But the advertising was primarily a way to launder bribes for political favors. 

The series is a must read.
