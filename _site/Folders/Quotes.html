    <ul class="">
      <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Theodore Roosevelt</span></li>
      <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“It has been my observation that most people get ahead during the time that others waste.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Henry Ford </span></li>

      <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“What focus means is saying no to something that you [think]-with every bone in your body-is a phenomenal idea. And you wake up thinking about it. And you say no to it because you're focusing on something else.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Steve Jobs</span></li>      
      <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“Positions are seldom lost because they have been destroyed, but almost invariably because the leader has decided in his own mind that the position cannot be held.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">— A. A. Vandegrift</span></li>
     <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“Your life is what your thoughts make it” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Marcus Aurelius </span></li>
     <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“The culture precedes positive results. It doesn't get tacked on as an afterthought on your way to the victory stand. Champions behave like champions before they’re champions; they have a winning standard of performance before they are winners.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Bill Walsh</span></li>
     <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">― Epictetus </span></li>
     <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“One more point: A good player never stops until he’s actually out, running as hard for first base on the almost-certain-to-be-caught fly or grounder as he would if he were sprinting the 100-yard dash. If Henry Ford hadn’t kept going in the early days despite ridicule, we would never have seen the Ford car. It’s been much the same with almost every great man you could name. He kept plugging when everybody said his chances of making first base were nil. You just can’t beat the person who never gives up.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Babe Ruth</span></li>
     <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“Success is stumbling from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Winston Churchill</span></li>

     <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“Enthusiasm is one of the most powerful engines of success. When you do a thing, do it with all your might. Put your whole soul into it.

Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Ralph Waldo Emerson</span></li>
     <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“If I had an hour to solve a problem, I would spend 55 minutes defining the problem, and then five minutes solving it.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Einstein</span></li>

     <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Abe Lincoln</span></li>
     <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- CG Jung</span></li>
     <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“Besides, it is a disgrace to grow old through sheer carelessness before seeing what manner of man you may become by developing your bodily strength and beauty to their highest limit.

Martin Treptow</span></li>
     <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“You want to make history you have to do historic things” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Kobe Bryant</span></li>

    <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“If a young man makes up his mind to work, there’s no limit to what he can do.

The more he goes back, the further he will be able to see ahead.” <span style="color: #2f175c;font-weight:600;">- Henry Ford</span></li>
    <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society.

    <li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“The science of government it is my duty to study, more than all other sciences; the arts of legislation and administration and negotiation ought to take the place of, indeed exclude, in a manner, all other arts. I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy.

	<li style="padding-bottom:5px;">“One of the things I’ve always found is that you’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You can’t start with the technology and try to figure out where you’re going to try to sell it. And I’ve made this mistake probably more than anybody else in this room.
