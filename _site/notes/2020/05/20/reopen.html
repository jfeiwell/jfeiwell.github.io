<h1>Some Common Sense on Reopening</h1>

<div class="highlight" style="margin-top:12px; margin-left:10px;">“The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.”<br />- Daniel Patrick Moynihan</div>

<p>In our current predicament the central conservative truth is correct, the culture is going to predict the success of our society. I cannot believe (sadly, actually, I can) that the details of reopening have become one big cultural virtue-signal-fest.</p>

<p>This is not that hard. We need to reopen or the carnage of individual livelihoods and the economic strength that underpins our geopolitical leverage will be decimated beyond repair. <strong>But that does not mean the threat has gone away</strong>.</p>

<p>Just because we’ve grown tired of the lockdowns doesn’t mean you can’t get sick. More importantly, doesn’t mean you can’t get someone else sick.</p>

<p>A friend sent me pics of a crowded Cleveland bar this weekend. Zero masks, zero distancing. This scene from Colorado is happening all across the US.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy Mother’s Day from C&amp; C in Castle Rock, where the owner said this is almost double a normal Mother’s Day. <a href="https://t.co/cPSzjmAfAg">pic.twitter.com/cPSzjmAfAg</a></p>&mdash; Nick Puckett (@nick__puckett) <a href="https://twitter.com/nick__puckett/status/1259541624389955584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Shortly after this video went viral the state revoked their license. That’s not okay either!</p>

<p>America is an individualistic society. You can’t keep us locked up, and you can’t deny businesses the right to earn a living. <strong>So it’s incumbent on us, the individuals, to be smart and take every single necessary precaution</strong>.</p>

<p>I am just as much a liberty loving blue blooded American as the next guy. I get that wearing a mask, avoiding crowds, and taking every necessary precaution sucks and has a stigma of collectivist adherence to overreaching state authority - but that’s all it is, a stigma.</p>

<p>If you want to <em>actually</em> go to baseball game, if you want to <em>actually</em> get loaded at a bar with friends, if you want to <em>actually</em>, get back to the office - wear the damn mask inside places and take the extra precautions in public. <strong>Don’t fall for the illusion of normalcy. Don’t ease up - compete. Compete against the virus and compete for Old Glory.</strong></p>

<p>The reason South Korea and Taiwan are able to contain this, why they have live baseball, is because they do those things well. I promise you going to the bars now is not worth a second wave in the winter that could leave hundreds of thousands of our American brothers and sisters dead. At those levels it will become personal for almost everyone.</p>

<p>I’m going to go out on a limb here and say most people who are culturally defiant on masks et al. are those who share a D-Day post every June 6th. I usually do that too. If that’s the case, ask yourself if staying home, wearing a mask, waiting a few minutes longer in lines, and taking the few extra minutes to protect yourself and others in public comes anywhere near that level of sacrifice. Here’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmiphUYwL_0">opening scene of <em>Saving Private Ryan</em></a> for reference.</p>

<p>I’m not saying become a comporting hermit, I’m saying just be smart so we can reopen - <strong>permanently</strong>.</p>

<p>America <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> only return to normal once we beat this.</p>
